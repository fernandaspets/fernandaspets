# The scope of the project:


 * Use Django's tools to create a skeleton website and application.
 * Create models to represent our application's data.
 * Use the Django admin site to populate our site's data.
 * Create views to retrieve specific data in response to different requests, and templates to render the data as HTML to be displayed in the browser.
 * Create mappers to associate different URL patterns with specific views.
 * Add user authorization and sessions to control site behavior and access.
 * Work with forms.
 * Write test code for our app.
 * Use Django's security effectively.
 * Deploy our application to production.
